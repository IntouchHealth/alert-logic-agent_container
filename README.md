# Alert Logic Agent for Kubernetes, ECS, and Docker

This repository contains definitions and documentation for deploying the Alert Logic Agent as a Container (al-agent-container) on various Docker platforms.

- Kubernetes
- ECS
- Docker

# Prerequisites

The documentation within this repository is provided to aid in the deployment of the Threat Manager Agent as a container.  The documentation *ONLY* covers the deployment of the agent and does not cover the prerequisite of having a deployed and active Threat Manager Appliance.

If you have not done so already, follow the instructions in the following link to deploy and configure Threat Manager.  Please note that any reference to the installation of the Threat Manager Agent should be replaced with deploying the al-agent-container as specified within this repository.
